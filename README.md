obs-manipulation-tools
======================

Rough scripts/templates used to manipulate rpm spec files for open build service (obs) packages.

These scripts are not production quality, do not come with real documentation, and are not parameterized for general use. If anything they demonstrate techniques and act as templates for doing one-off repetitive manipulation of packages.
